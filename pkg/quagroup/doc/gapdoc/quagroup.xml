<Chapter> <Heading>Introduction</Heading>

This is the manual for the &GAP; package <Package>QuaGroup</Package>, for 
doing computations with quantized enveloping algebras of semisimple Lie 
algebras.<P/>

Apart from the chapter you are currently reading, this document consists of 
two chapters. In Chapter <Ref Chap="chap2"/> we give 
a short summary of parts of the theory of quantized enveloping algebras. 
This fixes the notations and definitions that we use. Then in Chapter 
<Ref Chap="chap3"/> we describe the functions that 
constitute the package. <P/>

The package can be obtained from 
<URL>http://www.math.uu.nl/people/graaf/quagroup.html</URL> 
The directory <F>quagroup/doc</F> contains the manual of the package in 
<F>dvi</F>, <F>ps</F>, <F>pdf</F> and <F>html</F> format. 
The manual was built with the &GAP; share package 
<Package>GAPDoc</Package>, <Cite Key="LN01"/>. 
This means that, in order to be able to use the on-line help of 
<Package>QuaGroup</Package>, you have to install 
<Package>GAPDoc</Package> before calling 
<A>LoadPackage("quagroup");</A>. <P/>

The main algorithm of the package (on which virtually the whole functionality 
relies) is a method for computing with so-called PBW-type bases, analogous 
to Poincar\'{e}-Birkhoff-Witt bases in universal enveloping algebras. In 
both cases commutation relations between the generators are used. However, 
in the latter case all commutation relations are of the form <M>yx=xy+z</M>, 
where  <M>x,y</M> are generators, and <M>z</M> is a linear combination of 
generators. In the case of quantized enveloping algebras the 
situation is generally much more complicated. For example, in the quantized 
enveloping algebra of type <M>E_7</M> we have the following relation:

<Example>
F62*F26 = (q)*F26*F62+(1-q^2)*F28*F61+(-q+q^3)*F30*F60+(q^2-q^4)*F31*F59+
          (q^2-q^4)*F33*F58+(-q^3+q^5)*F34*F57+(q^4-q^6)*F35*F56+
          (q^-1-q-q^5+q^7)*F36*F55+(q^6)*F54
</Example>


Due to the complexity of these commutation relations, some computations 
(even with rather small input) may take quite some time.<P/>

Remark: The package can deal with quantized enveloping algebras corresponding 
to root systems of rank at least up to eight, except <M>E_8</M>. In that case 
the 
computation of the necessary commutation relations took more than 2 GB. 
I wish to thank Steve Linton for trying this computation on the machines in 
St Andrews.<P/>

The following example illustrates some of the features of the package.<P/>

<Chapter Label="chap2"> <Heading>Background</Heading>

In this chapter we summarize some of the theoretical concepts with which 
<Package>QuaGroup</Package> operates. Due to the rather mathematical nature 
of this chapter everything has been written in LaTeX. Therefore, it will be 
almost unreadable in the html version.

<Section Label="sec2.1"> <Heading>Gaussian Binomials</Heading>

Let $v$ be an indeterminate over $\mathbb{Q}$. For a positive integer $n$ 
we set
$$ [n] = v^{n-1}+v^{n-3}+\cdots + v^{-n+3}+v^{-n+1}. $$
We say that $[n]$ is the <E> Gaussian integer </E> corresponding to $n$. 
The <E> Gaussian factorial </E> $[n]!$ is defined by
$$ [0]! = 1, ~ [n]! = [n][n-1]\cdots [1], \text{ for } n>0.$$
Finally, the <E> Gaussian binomial </E> is
$$ \begin{bmatrix} n \\ k \end{bmatrix} = \frac{[n]!}{[k]![n-k]!}.$$
 
</Section>

<Section Label="sec2.2"> <Heading>Quantized enveloping algebras</Heading>

Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a semisimple Lie algebra with root system $\Phi$. 
By $\Delta=\{\alpha_1,\ldots, \alpha_l \}$ we denote a fixed simple system 
of $\Phi$. Let $C=(C_{ij})$ be the Cartan matrix of $\Phi$ (with respect to 
$\Delta$, i.e., $ C_{ij} = \langle \alpha_i, \alpha_j^{\vee} \rangle$). 
Let $d_1,\ldots, d_l$ be the unique sequence of positive integers with 
greatest common divisor $1$, such that $ d_i C_{ji} = d_j C_{ij} $, and set 
$ (\alpha_i,\alpha_j) = d_j C_{ij} $. (We note that this implies that 
$(\alpha_i,\alpha_i)$ is divisible by $2$.) By $P$ we denote the weight 
lattice, and we extend the form $(~,~)$ to $P$ by bilinearity. \par 
By $W(\Phi)$ we denote the Weyl group of $\Phi$. It is generated by the 
simple reflections $s_i=s_{\alpha_i}$ for $1\leq i\leq l$ (where 
$s_{\alpha}$ is defined by $s_{\alpha}(\beta) = \beta - \langle\beta, 
\alpha^{\vee}\rangle \alpha$).\par 
We work over the field $\mathbb{Q}(q)$. For $\alpha\in\Phi $ we set
$$ q_{\alpha} = q^{\frac{(\alpha,\alpha)}{2}},$$
and for a non-negative integer $n$, $[n]_{\alpha}= [n]_{v=q_{\alpha}}$; 
$[n]_{\alpha}!$ and $\begin{bmatrix} n \\ k \end{bmatrix}_{\alpha}$ are 
defined analogously.\par 
The quantized enveloping algebra $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ is the associative 
algebra (with one) over $\mathbb{Q}(q)$ generated by $F_{\alpha}$, 
$K_{\alpha}$, $K_{\alpha}^{-1}$, $E_{\alpha}$ for $\alpha\in\Delta$, 
subject to the following relations 
\begin{align*} 
K_{\alpha}K_{\alpha}^{-1} &amp;= K_{\alpha}^{-1}K_{\alpha} = 1,~ 
K_{\alpha}K_{\beta} = K_{\beta}K_{\alpha}\\ 
E_{\beta} K_{\alpha} &amp;= q^{-(\alpha,\beta)}K_{\alpha} E_{\beta}\\ 
K_{\alpha} F_{\beta} &amp;= q^{-(\alpha,\beta)}F_{\beta}K_{\alpha}\\ 
E_{\alpha} F_{\beta} &amp;= F_{\beta}E_{\alpha} +\delta_{\alpha,\beta} 
\frac{K_{\alpha}-K_{\alpha}^{-1}}{q_{\alpha}-q_{\alpha}^{-1}} 
\end{align*} 
together with, for $\alpha\neq \beta\in\Delta$, 
\begin{align*} 
\sum_{k=0}^{1-\langle \beta,\alpha^{\vee}\rangle } 
(-1)^k \begin{bmatrix} 1-\langle \beta,\alpha^{\vee}\rangle \\ k 
\end{bmatrix}_{\alpha} E_{\alpha}^{1-\langle \beta,\alpha^{\vee}\rangle-k} 
E_{\beta} E_{\alpha}^k =0 &amp; \\ 
\sum_{k=0}^{1-\langle \beta,\alpha^{\vee}\rangle } (-1)^k \begin{bmatrix} 
1-\langle \beta,\alpha^{\vee}\rangle \\ k \end{bmatrix}_{\alpha} 
F_{\alpha}^{1-\langle \beta,\alpha^{\vee}\rangle-k} 
F_{\beta} F_{\alpha}^k =0 &amp;. 
\end{align*} 
The quantized enveloping algebra has an automorphism $\omega$ defined by 
$\omega( F_{\alpha} ) = E_{\alpha}$, $\omega(E_{\alpha})= F_{\alpha}$ and 
$\omega(K_{\alpha})=K_{\alpha}^{-1}$. Also there is an anti-automorphism 
$\tau$ defined by $\tau(F_{\alpha})=F_{\alpha}$, $\tau(E_{\alpha})=
E_{\alpha}$ and $\tau(K_{\alpha})=K_{\alpha}^{-1}$. We have $\omega^2=1$ 
and $\tau^2=1$.\par 
If the Dynkin diagram of $\Phi$ admits a diagram automorphism $\pi$, then 
$\pi$ induces an automorphism of $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ in the obvious way 
($\pi$ is a permutation of the simple roots; we permute the $F_{\alpha}$, 
$E_{\alpha}$, $K_{\alpha}^{\pm 1}$ accordingly).\par 
Now we view $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ as an algebra over $\mathbb{Q}$, and we let 
$\overline{\phantom{A}} : U_q(\mathfrak{g})\to U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ be the 
automorphism defined by $\overline{F_{\alpha}}=F_{\alpha}$, 
$\overline{K_{\alpha}}= K_{\alpha}^{-1}$, $\overline{E_{\alpha}}=E_{\alpha}$,
 $\overline{q}=q^{-1}$.

<Section Label="sec2.3"> <Heading>Representations of $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$  </Heading>

Let $\lambda\in P$ be a dominant weight. Then there is a unique irreducible 
highest-weight module over $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ with highest weight $\lambda$. 
We denote it by $V(\lambda)$. It has the same character as the irreducible 
highest-weight module over $\mathfrak{g}$ with highest weight $\lambda$. 
Furthermore, every finite-dimensional $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$-module is a direct 
sum of irreducible highest-weight modules.\par 
It is well-known that $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ is a Hopf algebra. The 
comultiplication $\Delta : U_q(\mathfrak{g})\to U_q(\mathfrak{g})
\otimes U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ is defined by 
\begin{align*} 
\Delta(E_{\alpha}) &amp;= E_{\alpha}\otimes 1 + K_{\alpha}\otimes E_{\alpha}\\
\Delta(F_{\alpha}) &amp;= F_{\alpha}\otimes K_{\alpha}^{-1} + 
1\otimes F_{\alpha}\\ 
\Delta(K_{\alpha}) &amp;= K_{\alpha}\otimes K_{\alpha}.
\end{align*} 
(Note that we use the same symbol to denote a simple system of $\Phi$; of 
course this does not cause confusion.) The counit $\varepsilon : 
U_q(\mathfrak{g}) \to \mathbb{Q}(q)$ is a homomorphism defined by 
$\varepsilon(E_{\alpha})=\varepsilon(F_{\alpha})=0$, 
$\varepsilon( K_{\alpha}) =1$. Finally, the antipode 
$S: U_q(\mathfrak{g})\to U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ is an anti-automorphism given 
by $S(E_{\alpha})=-K_{\alpha}^{-1}E_{\alpha}$, $S(F_{\alpha})=-F_{\alpha}
K_{\alpha}$, $S(K_{\alpha})=K_{\alpha}^{-1}$.\par 
Using $\Delta$ we can make the tensor product $V\otimes W$ of two 
$U_q(\mathfrak{g})$-modules $V,W$ into a $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$-module. 
The counit $\varepsilon$ yields a trivial $1$-dimensional 
$U_q(\mathfrak{g})$-module. And with $S$ we can define a 
$U_q(\mathfrak{g})$-module structure on the dual $V^*$ of a 
$U_q(\mathfrak{g})$-module $V$, by $(u\cdot f)(v) = f(S(u)\cdot v )$.\par 
The Hopf algebra structure given above is not the only one possible. For 
example, we can twist $\Delta,\varepsilon,S$ by an automorphism, or an 
anti-automorphism $f$. The twisted comultiplication is given by 
$$\Delta^f = f\otimes f \circ\Delta\circ f^{-1}.$$ 
The twisted antipode by 
$$ S^f = \begin{cases} f\circ S\circ f^{-1} \text{ ~~~~if $f$ is an 
automorphism}\\ f\circ S^{-1}\circ f^{-1} 
\text{ ~if $f$ is an anti-automorphism.}\end{cases}$$ 
And the twisted counit by $\varepsilon^f = \varepsilon\circ f^{-1}$ 
(see <Cite Key="J96"/>, 3.8).

<Section Label="sec2.4"> <Heading>PBW-type bases </Heading>

The first problem one has to deal with when working with $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ 
is finding a basis of it, along with an algorithm for expressing the product 
of two basis elements as a linear combination of basis elements. 
First of all we have that $U_q(\mathfrak{g})\cong U^-\otimes U^0\otimes U^+$ 
(as vector spaces), where $U^-$ is the subalgebra generated by the 
$F_{\alpha}$, $U^0$ is the subalgebra generated by the $K_{\alpha}$, and 
$U^+$ is generated by the $E_{\alpha}$. So a basis of $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ is 
formed by all elements $FKE$, where $F$, $K$, $E$ run through bases of $U^-$, 
$U^0$, $U^+$ respectively.\par 
Finding a basis of $U^0$ is easy: it is spanned by all $K_{\alpha_1}^{r_1} 
\cdots K_{\alpha_l}^{r_l}$, where $r_i\in\mathbb{Z}$. For $U^-$, $U^+$ we 
use the so-called {\em PBW-type} bases. They are defined as follows. 
For $\alpha,\beta\in\Delta$ we set $r_{\beta,\alpha} = -\langle \beta,
\alpha^{\vee}\rangle$. Then for $\alpha\in\Delta$ we have the automorphism 
$T_{\alpha} : U_q(\mathfrak{g})\to U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ defined by 
\begin{align*} 
T_{\alpha}(E_{\alpha}) &amp;= -F_{\alpha}K_{\alpha}\\ 
T_{\alpha}(E_{\beta}) &amp;= \sum_{i=0}^{r_{\beta,\alpha}} 
(-1)^i q_{\alpha}^{-i} E_{\alpha}^{(r_{\beta,\alpha}-i)}E_{\beta}
E_{\alpha}^{(i)} \text{ (for $\alpha\neq\beta$)}\\ 
T_{\alpha}(K_{\beta}) &amp;= K_{\beta}K_{\alpha}^{r_{\beta,\alpha}}\\ 
T_{\alpha}(F_{\alpha}) &amp;= -K_{\alpha}^{-1} E_{\alpha}\\ 
T_{\alpha}(F_{\beta}) &amp;= \sum_{i=0}^{r_{\beta,\alpha}} 
(-1)^i q_{\alpha}^{i} F_{\alpha}^{(i)}F_{\beta}F_{\alpha}^ 
{(r_{\beta,\alpha}-i)}\text{ (for $\alpha\neq\beta$),} 
\end{align*} 
(where $E_{\alpha}^{(k)} = E_{\alpha}^k/[k]_{\alpha}!$, and likewise for 
$F_{\alpha}^{(k)}$). \par 
Let $w_0=s_{i_1}\cdots s_{i_t}$ be a reduced expression for the longest 
element in the Weyl group $W(\Phi)$. For $1\leq k\leq t$ set 
$F_k = T_{\alpha_{i_1}}\cdots T_{\alpha_{i_{k-1}}}(F_{\alpha_{i_k}})$, 
and $E_k = T_{\alpha_{i_1}}\cdots T_{\alpha_{i_{k-1}}}(E_{\alpha_{i_k}})$. 
Then $F_k\in U^-$, and $E_k\in U^+$. Furthermore, the elements $F_1^{m_1}
\cdots F_t^{m_t}$, $E_1^{n_1}\cdots E_t^{n_t}$ (where the $m_i$, $n_i$ 
are non-negative integers) form bases of $U^-$ and $U^+$ respectively. \par 
The elements $F_{\alpha}$ and $E_{\alpha}$ are said to have weight 
$-\alpha$ and $\alpha$ respectively, where $\alpha$ is a simple root. 
Furthermore, the weight of a product $ab$ is the sum of the weights of $a$ 
and $b$. Now elements of $U^-$, $U^+$ that are linear combinations of elements
of the same weight are said to be homogeneous. It can be shown that the 
elements $F_k$, and $E_k$ are homogeneous of weight $-\beta$ and $\beta$ 
respectively, where $\beta=s_{i_1}\cdots s_{i_{k-1}}(\alpha_{i_k})$. \par 
In the sequel we use the notation $F_k^{(m)} = F_k^m/[m]_{\alpha_{i_k}}!$, 
and $E_k^{(n)} = E_k^n/[n]_{\alpha_{i_k}}!$. \par

<Section Label="sec2.5"> <Heading>The ${\mathbb Z}$-form of $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ </Heading>

For $\alpha\in\Delta$ set 
$$\begin{bmatrix} K_{\alpha} \\ n \end{bmatrix} = \prod_{i=1}^n 
\frac{q_{\alpha}^{-i+1}K_{\alpha} - q_{\alpha}^{i-1} K_{\alpha}^{-1}}
{q_{\alpha}^i-q_{\alpha}^{-i}}.$$ 
Then according to <Cite Key="L90"/>, Theorem 6.7 the elements 
$$F_1^{(k_1)}\cdots F_t^{(k_t)} K_{\alpha_1}^{\delta_1} 
\begin{bmatrix} K_{\alpha_1} \\ m_1 \end{bmatrix} 
\cdots K_{\alpha_l}^{\delta_l}
\begin{bmatrix} K_{\alpha_l} \\ m_l \end{bmatrix} 
E_1^{(n_1)}\cdots E_t^{(n_t)},$$ 
(where $k_i,m_i,n_i\geq 0$, $\delta_i=0,1$) form a basis of 
$U_q(\mathfrak{g})$, such that the product of any two basis elements is a 
linear combination of basis elements with coefficients in 
$\mathbb{Z}[q,q^{-1}]$. The quantized enveloping algebra over 
$\mathbb{Z}[q,q^{-1}]$ with this basis is called the $\mathbb{Z}$-form of 
$U_q(\mathfrak{g})$, and denoted by $U_{\mathbb{Z}}$. Since $U_{\mathbb{Z}}$ 
is defined over $\mathbb{Z}[q,q^{-1}]$ we can specialize $q$ to any nonzero 
element $\epsilon$ of a field $F$, and obtain an algebra $U_{\epsilon}$ over 
$F$. \par 
We call $q\in \mathbb{Q}(q)$, and $\epsilon \in F$ the quantum parameter of 
$U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ and $U_{\epsilon}$ respectively. \par 
Let $\lambda$ be a dominant weight, and $V(\lambda)$ the irreducible highest 
weight module of highest weight $\lambda$ over $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$. Let 
$v_{\lambda}\in V(\lambda)$ be a fixed highest weight vector. Then 
$U_{\mathbb{Z}}\cdot v_{\lambda}$ is a $U_{\mathbb{Z}}$-module. So by 
specializing $q$ to an element $\epsilon$ of a field $F$, we get a 
$U_{\epsilon}$-module. We call it the Weyl module of highest weight $\lambda$ 
over $U_{\epsilon}$. We note that it is not necessarily irreducible.

</Section>

<Section Label="sec2.6"> <Heading>The canonical basis </Heading>

As in Section <Ref Sect="sec2.4"/> we let $U^-$ be the subalgebra of 
$U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ generated by the $F_{\alpha}$ for $\alpha\in\Delta$. 
In <Cite Key="L0a"/> Lusztig 
introduced a basis of $U^-$ with very nice properties, 
called the {\em canonical basis}. (Later this basis was also constructed
by Kashiwara, using a different method. For a brief overview on the history of
canonical bases we refer to <Cite Key="C06"/>.) \par 
Let $w_0=s_{i_1}\cdots s_{i_t}$, and the elements $F_k$ be as in Section 
<Ref Sect="sec2.4"/>. Then, in order to stress the dependency of the monomial
\begin{equation}\label{eq0} 
F_1^{(n_1)}\cdots F_t^{(n_t)} 
\end{equation} 
on the choice of reduced expression for the longest element in $W(\Phi)$ we 
say that it is a $w_0$-monomial.\par 
Now we let $\overline{\phantom{a}}$ be the automorphism of $U^-$ defined in 
Section <Ref Sect="sec2.2"/>. Elements that are invariant under 
$\overline{\phantom{a}}$ are said to be bar-invariant. \par 
By results of Lusztig (<Cite Key="L93"/> Theorem 42.1.10, 
<Cite Key="L96"/>, Proposition 8.2), there is a unique basis 
${\bf B}$ of $U^-$ with the following properties. Firstly, all elements of 
${\bf B}$ are bar-invariant. Secondly, for any choice of reduced expression 
$w_0$ for the longest element in the Weyl group, and any element $X\in{\bf B}$ 
we have that $X = x +\sum \zeta_i x_i$, where $x,x_i$ are $w_0$-monomials, 
$x\neq x_i$ for all $i$, and $\zeta_i\in q\mathbb{Z}[q]$. The basis ${\bf B}$ 
is called the canonical basis. If we work with a fixed reduced expression 
for the longest element in $W(\Phi)$, and write $X\in{\bf B}$ as above, 
then we say that $x$ is the {\em principal monomial} of $X$.\par 
Let $\mathcal{L}$ be the $\mathbb{Z}[q]$-lattice in $U^-$ spanned by {\bf B}. 
Then $\mathcal{L}$ is also spanned by all $w_0$-monomials (where $w_0$ is 
a fixed reduced expression for the longest element in $W(\Phi)$). Now 
let $\widetilde{w}_0$ be a second reduced expression for the longest element 
in $W(\Phi)$. Let $x$ be a $w_0$-monomial, and let $X$ be the element of 
{\bf B} with principal monomial $x$. Write $X$ as a linear combination of 
$\widetilde{w}_0$-monomials, and let $\widetilde{x}$ be the principal monomial 
of that expression. Then we write $\widetilde{x} = R_{w_0}^{\tilde{w}_0}(x)$. 
Note that $x = \widetilde{x} \bmod q\mathcal{L}$. \par 
Now let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of all $w_0$-monomials $\bmod q\mathcal{L}$. 
Then $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis of the $\mathbb{Z}$-module 
$\mathcal{L}/q\mathcal{L}$. Moreover, $\mathcal{B}$ is independent of the 
choice of $w_0$. Let $\alpha\in\Delta$, and let $\widetilde{w}_0$ be a 
reduced expression for the longest element in $W(\Phi)$, starting with 
$s_{\alpha}$. The Kashiwara operators $\widetilde{F}_{ \alpha} : 
\mathcal{B}\to \mathcal{B}$ and $\widetilde{E}_{\alpha} : \mathcal{B}\to 
\mathcal{B}\cup\{0\}$ are defined as follows. Let $b\in\mathcal{B}$ and 
let $x$ be the $w_0$-monomial such that $b = x \bmod q\mathcal{L}$. Set 
$\widetilde{x} = R_{w_0}^ {\tilde{w}_0}(x)$. Then $\widetilde{x}'$ is the 
$\widetilde{w}_0$-monomial constructed from $\widetilde{x}$ by increasing 
its first exponent by $1$ (the first exponent is the $n_1$ in (\ref{eq0})). 
Then $\widetilde{F}_{ \alpha}(b) = R_{\tilde{w}_0}^{w_0}(\widetilde{x}') 
\bmod q\mathcal{L}$. For $\widetilde{E}_{\alpha}$ we let $\widetilde{x}'$ 
be the $\widetilde{w}_0$-monomial constructed from $\widetilde{x}$ by 
decreasing its first exponent by $1$, if this exponent is $\geq 1$. Then 
$\widetilde{E}_{\alpha}(b) = R_{\tilde{w}_0}^{w_0}(\widetilde{x}')\bmod 
q\mathcal{L}$. Furthermore, $\widetilde{E}_{\alpha}(b) =0$ if the first 
exponent of $\widetilde{x}$ is $0$. It can be shown that this definition does 
not depend on the choice of $w_0$, $\widetilde{w}_0$. Furthermore we have 
$\widetilde{F}_{\alpha}\widetilde{E}_{\alpha}(b)=b$, if 
$\widetilde{E}_{\alpha}(b)\neq 0$, and $\widetilde{E}_{\alpha}
\widetilde{F}_ {\alpha}(b)=b$ for all $b\in \mathcal{B}$.\par 
Let $w_0=s_{i_1}\cdots s_{i_t}$ be a fixed reduced expression for the 
longest element in $W(\Phi)$. For $b\in\mathcal{B}$ we define a sequence of 
elements $b_k\in\mathcal{B}$ for $0\leq k\leq t$, and a sequence of integers 
$n_k$ for $1\leq k\leq t$ as follows. We set $b_0=b$, and if $b_{k-1}$ is 
defined we let $n_k$ be maximal such that $\widetilde{E}_{\alpha_{i_k}}^ 
{n_k}(b_{k-1})\neq 0$. Also we set $b_k = \widetilde{E}_{\alpha_{i_k}}^{n_k} 
(b_{k-1})$. Then the sequence $(n_1,\ldots,n_t)$ is called the {\em string} 
of $b\in\mathcal{B}$ (relative to $w_0$). We note that 
$b=\widetilde{F}_ {\alpha_{i_1}}^{n_1}\cdots \widetilde{F}_{\alpha_{i_t}}^
{n_t}(1)$. The set of all strings parametrizes the elements of $\mathcal{B}$, 
and hence of ${\bf B}$.\par 
Now let $V(\lambda)$ be a highest-weight module over $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$, 
with highest weight $\lambda$. Let $v_{\lambda}$ be a fixed highest weight 
vector. Then ${\bf B}_{\lambda} = \{ X\cdot v_{\lambda}\mid X\in {\bf B}\} 
\setminus \{0\}$ is a basis of $V(\lambda)$, called the {\em canonical basis}, 
or {\em crystal basis} of $V(\lambda)$. Let $\mathcal{L}(\lambda)$ be the 
$\mathbb{Z}[q]$-lattice in $V(\lambda)$ spanned by ${\bf B}_{\lambda}$. We 
let $\mathcal{B}({\lambda})$ be the set of all $x\cdot v_{\lambda}\bmod 
q\mathcal{L}(\lambda)$, where $x$ runs through all $w_0$-monomials, such 
that $X\cdot v_{\lambda} \neq 0$, where $X\in {\bf B}$ is the element with 
principal monomial $x$. Then the Kashiwara operators are also viewed as 
maps $\mathcal{B}(\lambda)\to \mathcal{B}(\lambda)\cup\{0\}$, in the following 
way. Let $b=x\cdot v_{\lambda}\bmod q\mathcal{L}(\lambda)$ be an element 
of $\mathcal{B}(\lambda)$, and let $b'=x\bmod q\mathcal{L}$ be the 
corresponding element of $\mathcal{B}$. Let $y$ be the $w_0$-monomial such 
that $\widetilde{F}_{\alpha}(b')=y\bmod q\mathcal{L}$. Then 
$\widetilde{F}_{ \alpha}(b) = y\cdot v_{\lambda} \bmod q\mathcal{L}(\lambda)$. 
The description of $\widetilde{E}_{\alpha}$ is analogous. (In 
<Cite Key="J96"/>, Chapter 9 a different definition is given; however, by 
<Cite Key="J96"/>, Proposition 10.9, Lemma 10.13, the two definitions 
agree).\par 
The set $\mathcal{B}(\lambda)$ has $\dim V(\lambda)$ elements. We let 
$\Gamma$ be the coloured directed graph defined as follows. The points of 
$\Gamma$ are the elements of $\mathcal{B}(\lambda)$, and there is an arrow 
with colour $\alpha\in\Delta$ connecting $b,b'\in \mathcal{B}$, if 
$\widetilde{F}_{\alpha}(b)=b'$. The graph $\Gamma$ is called the 
{\em crystal graph} of $V(\lambda)$.

<Section Label="sec2.7"> <Heading> The path model </Heading>

In this section we recall some basic facts on Littelmann's path model. \par 
From Section <Ref Sect="sec2.2"/> we recall that $P$ denotes the weight 
lattice. Let $P_{\mathbb{R}}$ be the vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ spanned 
by $P$. Let $\Pi$ be the set of all piecewise linear paths 
$\xi : [0,1]\to P_{\mathbb{R} $, such that $\xi(0)=0$. For $\alpha\in\Delta$ 
Littelmann defined operators $f_{\alpha}, e_{\alpha} : \Pi \to \Pi\cup \{0\}$. 
Let $\lambda$ be a dominant weight and let $\xi_{\lambda}$ be the path joining 
$\lambda$ and the origin by a straight line. Let $\Pi_{\lambda}$ be the set 
of all nonzero $f_{\alpha_{i_1}}\cdots f_{\alpha_{i_m}}(\xi_{\lambda})$ for 
$m\geq 0$. Then $\xi(1)\in P$ for all $\xi\in \Pi_{\lambda}$. Let $\mu\in P$ 
be a weight, and let $V(\lambda)$ be the highest-weight module over 
$U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ of highest weight $\lambda$. A theorem of Littelmann 
states that the number of paths $\xi\in \Pi_{\lambda}$ such that $\xi(1)=\mu$ 
is equal to the dimension of the weight space of weight $\mu$ in $V(\lambda)$ 
(<Cite Key="L95"/>, Theorem 9.1).\par 
All paths appearing in $\Pi_{\lambda}$ are so-called Lakshmibai-Seshadri 
paths (LS-paths for short). They are defined as follows. Let $\leq$ denote 
the Bruhat order on $W(\Phi)$. For $\mu,\nu\in W(\Phi)\cdot \lambda$ (the 
orbit of $\lambda$ under the action of $W(\Phi)$), write $\mu\leq \nu$ if 
$\tau\leq\sigma$, where $\tau,\sigma\in W(\Phi)$ are the unique elements 
of minimal length such that $\tau(\lambda)=\mu$, $\sigma(\lambda)= \nu$. 
Now a rational path of shape $\lambda$ is a pair $\pi=(\nu,a)$, where 
$\nu=(\nu_1,\ldots, \nu_s)$ is a sequence of elements of $W(\Phi)\cdot 
\lambda$, such that $\nu_i> \nu_{i+1}$ and $a=(a_0=0, a_1, \cdots ,a_s=1)$ 
is a sequence of rationals such that $a_i &lt;a_{i+1}$. The path $\pi$ 
corresponding to these sequences is given by 
$$ \pi(t) =\sum_{j=1}^{r-1} (a_j-a_{j-1})\nu_j + \nu_r(t-a_{r-1})$$ 
for $a_{r-1}\leq t\leq a_r$. Now an LS-path of shape $\lambda$ is a rational 
path satisfying a certain integrality condition (see 
<Cite Key="L94"/>, <Cite Key="L95"/>). We note that the path $\xi_{\lambda} 
= ( (\lambda), (0,1) )$ joining the origin and $\lambda$ by a straight line 
is an LS-path.\par 
Now from <Cite Key="L94"/>, <Cite Key="L95"/> we transcribe the following: 
\begin{itemize} 
\item Let $\pi$ be an LS-path. Then $f_{\alpha}\pi$ is an LS-path or $0$; 
and the same holds for $e_{\alpha}\pi$. 
\item The action of $f_{\alpha},e_{\alpha}$ can easily be described 
combinatorially (see <Cite Key="L94"/>). 
\item The endpoint of an LS-path is an integral weight. 
\item Let $\pi=(\nu,a)$ be an LS-path. Then by $\phi(\pi)$ we denote the 
unique element $\sigma$ of $W(\Phi)$ of shortest length such that 
$\sigma(\lambda)=\nu_1$. 
\end{itemize} 
Let $\lambda$ be a dominant weight. Then we define a labeled directed graph 
$\Gamma$ as follows. The points of $\Gamma$ are the paths in $\Pi_{\lambda}$. 
There is an edge with label $\alpha\in\Delta$ from $\pi_1$ to $\pi_2$ if 
$f_{\alpha}\pi_1 =\pi_2$. Now by <Cite Key="K96"/> this graph $\Gamma$ is 
isomorphic to the crystal graph of the highest-weight module with highest 
weight $\lambda$. So the path model provides an efficient way of computing 
the crystal graph of a highest-weight module, without constructing the module 
first. Also we see that $f_{\alpha_{i_1}}\cdots f_{\alpha_{i_r}}\xi_{\lambda}
=0$ is equivalent to $\widetilde{F}_{\alpha_{i_1}}\cdots \widetilde{F}_ 
{\alpha_{i_r}}v_{\lambda}=0$, where $v_{\lambda}\in V(\lambda)$ is a 
highest weight vector (or rather the image of it in $\mathcal{L}(\lambda)/
q\mathcal{L} (\lambda)$), and the $\widetilde{F}_{\alpha_k}$ are the 
Kashiwara operators on $\mathcal{B}(\lambda)$ (see Section 
<Ref Sect="sec2.6"/>).

<Section> <Heading>Roots and root systems</Heading>

In  this  section  we describe some functions for dealing with root systems.
These functions supplement the ones already present in the &GAP; library.

<ManSection> 
<Oper Name="RootSystem" Arg="type, rank"/>
<Oper Name="RootSystem" Arg="list"/>
<Description>
Here  <A>type</A>  is  a capital letter between <A>"A"</A> and <A>"G"</A>, 
and <A>rank</A> is a positive integer (<M>\geq 1</M> if <A>type="A"</A>, 
<M>\geq 2</M> if <A>type="B"</A>, <A>"C"</A>, <M>\geq 4</M> if 
<A>type="D"</A>, <M>6,7,8</M> if <A>type="E"</A>,  <M>4</M> if 
<A>type="F"</A>, and <M>2</M> if <A>type="G"</A>). This function returns 
the root system  of  type  <A>type</A>  and  rank <A>rank</A>. In the second 
form <A>list</A> is a list of types and ranks, e.g.,  
<A>[ "B", 2, "F", 4, "D", 7 ]</A>. <P/>
The root system constructed by this function comes with he attributes
<A>PositiveRoots</A>, <A>NegativeRoots</A>, <A>SimpleSystem</A>, 
<A>CartanMatrix</A>, <A>BilinearFormMat</A>. Here the attribute 
<A>SimpleSystem</A> contains a set of simple roots, written as
unit vectors. <A>PositiveRoots</A> is a list of the positive roots, written as
linear combinations of the simple roots, and likewise for <A>NegativeRoots</A>.
<A>CartanMatrix( R )</A> is the Cartan matrix of the root system <A>R</A>, 
where the entry on position <M>( i, j )</M> is given by <M>\langle \alpha_i, 
\alpha_j^{\vee}\rangle</M> where <M>\alpha_i</M> is the <M>i</M>-th simple root. 
<A>BilinearFormMat( R )</A> is the matrix of the bilinear form,
where the entry on position <M>( i, j )</M> is given by <M>( \alpha_i, 
\alpha_j )</M> (see Section <Ref Sect="sec2.2"/>).<P/>
<A>WeylGroup( R )</A> returns the Weyl group of the root system <A>R</A>. 
We refer to the &GAP; reference manual for an overview of the functions for 
Weyl groups in the &GAP; library. We mention the functions 
<A>ConjugateDominantWeight( W, wt )</A> (returns the dominant weight in the 
<A>W</A>-orbit of the weight <A>wt</A>), and <A>WeylOrbitIterator( W, wt )</A>
(returns an iterator for the <A>W</A>-orbit containing the weight <A>wt</A>). 
We write weights as integral linear combinations of fundamental weights, so 
in &GAP; weights are represented by lists of integers
(of length equal to the rank of the root system). <P/>
Also we mention the function <A>PositiveRootsAsWeights( R )</A> that returns 
the positive roots of <A>R</A> written as weights, i.e., as linear 
combinations of the fundamental weights.
<Example>
gap> R:=RootSystem( [ "B", 2, "F", 4, "E", 6 ] );
&lt;root system of type B2 F4 E6>
gap> R:= RootSystem( "A", 2 );
&lt;root system of type A2>
gap> PositiveRoots( R );

gap> ConjugateDominantWeight( W, [-3,2] );
[ 2, 1 ]
gap> o:= WeylOrbitIterator( W, [-3,2] );
&lt;iterator>
# Using the iterator we can loop over the orbit:
gap> NextIterator( o );

gap> NextIterator( o );

<Attr Name="BilinearFormMatNF" Arg="R"/>
<Description>
This  is  the  matrix of the <Q>normalized</Q> bilinear form. This means 
that all diagonal  entries  are  even,  and  2  is the minimum value 
occurring on the diagonal. If <A>R</A> is a root system constructed by 
<Ref Oper="RootSystem"/>, then this is equal to <A>BilinearFormMat( R )</A>.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>         
<Attr Name="PositiveRootsNF" Arg="R"/>
<Description>
This  is  the list of positive roots of the root system <A>R</A>, written 
as linear combinations  of the simple roots. This means that the simple roots 
are unit vectors. If <A>R</A> is a root system constructed by 
<Ref Oper="RootSystem"/>, then this is equal to <A>PositiveRoots( R )</A>. <P/>
One  of  the  reasons  for  writing  the  positive  roots  like  this is the
following.  Let  <A>a, b</A> be two elements of <A>PositiveRootsNF( R )</A>, 
and let <A>B</A> be the  matrix  of  the bilinear form. Then 
<A>a*( B*b )</A> is the result of applying the bilinear form to <A>a, b</A>.

<Example>
gap> R:= RootSystem( SimpleLieAlgebra( "B", 2, Rationals ) );;
gap> PositiveRootsNF( R );
[ [ 1, 0 ], [ 0, 1 ], [ 1, 1 ], [ 1, 2 ] ]
# We note that in this case PositiveRoots( R ) will give the positive roots in
# a different format.

<ManSection>         
<Attr Name="SimpleSystemNF" Arg="R"/>
<Description>
This  is  the list of simple roots of <A>R</A>, written as unit vectors 
(this means that  they  are  elements  of  <A>PositiveRootsNF(  R )</A>). 
If <A>R</A> is a root system constructed by <Ref Oper="RootSystem"/>, then 
this is equal to <A>SimpleSystem( R )</A>.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>         
<Attr Name="PositiveRootsInConvexOrder" Arg="R"/>
<Description>
This  function  returns  the  positive  roots  of  the root system <A>R</A>, 
in the <Q>convex</Q>  order. Let <M>w_0=s_1\cdots s_t</M> be a reduced 
expression of the longest element  in  the  Weyl  group. Then the <M>k</M>-th 
element of the list returned by this function is <M>s_1\cdots s_{k-1}(\alpha_k)
</M>. (Where the reduced expression used is  the one returned by 
<A>LongestWeylWord( R )</A>.) If <M>\alpha</M>, <M>\beta</M> and 
<M>\alpha+\beta</M> are  positive  roots,  then <M>\alpha+\beta</M> occurs 
between <M>\alpha</M> and <M>\beta</M> (whence the name convex order).<P/>
In  the  output all roots are written in <Q>normal form</Q>, i.e., as 
elements of <A>PositiveRootsNF( R )</A>.

<Example>
gap> R:= RootSystem( "G", 2 );;
gap> PositiveRootsInConvexOrder( R );

<Section> <Heading>Weyl groups and their elements</Heading>

Now  we  describe  a  few functions that deal with reduced words in the Weyl
group of the root system <A>R</A>. These words are represented as lists of 
positive integers <M>i</M>,  denoting  the  <M>i</M>-th simple reflection 
(which corresponds to the <M>i</M>-th element of <A>SimpleSystem( R )</A>). 
For example <A>[ 3, 2, 1, 3, 1 ]</A> represents
the expression <M>s_3 s_2 s_1 s_3 s_1</M>.

<ManSection>         
<Oper Name="ApplyWeylElement" Arg="W, wt, wd"/>
<Description>
Here <A>wd</A> is a (not necessarily reduced) word in the Weyl group <A>W</A>, 
and <A>wt</A> is a weight  (written as integral linear combination of the 
simple weights). This function returns the result of applying <A>wd</A> to 
<A>wt</A>. For example, if <A>wt=</A><M>\mu</M>, and
<A>wd = [ 1, 2 ]</A> then this function returns <M>s_1s_2(\mu)</M> (where 
<M>s_i</M> is the simple reflection corresponding to the <M>i</M>-th simple 
root).

<Example>
gap> W:= WeylGroup( RootSystem( "G", 2 ) ) ;;
gap> ApplyWeylElement( W, [ -3, 7 ], [ 1, 1, 2, 1, 2 ] );
[ 15, -11 ]

<ManSection>         
<Oper Name="LengthOfWeylWord" Arg="W, wd"/>
<Description>
Here  <A>wd</A>  is a word in the Weyl group <A>W</A>. This function returns 
the length of that word.

<Example>
gap> W:= WeylGroup( RootSystem( "F", 4 ) ) ;
&lt;matrix group with 4 generators>
gap> LengthOfWeylWord( W, [ 1, 3, 2, 4, 2 ] );

</Example>
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>         
<Attr Name="LongestWeylWord" Arg="R"/>
<Description>
Here  <A>R</A>  is  a root system. <A>LongestWeylWord( R )</A> returns the 
longest word in the Weyl group of <A>R</A>. <P/>
If this function is called for a root system <A>R</A>, a reduced expression 
for the longest  element  in  the  Weyl  group  is  calculated (the one which 
is the smallest  in  the  lexicographical  ordering). However, if you would 
like to work  with  a different reduced expression, then it is possible to 
set it by <A>SetLongestWeylWord( R, wd )</A>, where <A>wd</A> is a reduced 
expression of the longest element in the Weyl group. Note that you will have 
to do this before calling <A>LongestWeylWord</A>,  or  any  function  that 
may call <A>LongestWeylWord</A> (once the attribute  is set, it will not be 
possible to change it). Note also that you must  be sure that the word you 
give is in fact a reduced expression for the
longest  element  in  the  Weyl group, as this is not checked (you can check
this with <Ref Oper="LengthOfWeylWord"/>). <P/>
We  note  that  virtually  all  algorithms for quantized enveloping algebras
depend  on  the  choice of reduced expression for the longest element in the
Weyl group (as the PBW-type basis depends on this).

<Example>
gap> R:= RootSystem( "G", 2 );;
gap> LongestWeylWord( R );
[ 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2 ]
</Example>
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>         
<Oper Name="ReducedWordIterator" Arg="W, wd"/>
<Description>
Here  <A>W</A>  is  a  Weyl  group, and <A>wd</A> a reduced word. This 
function returns an iterator for the set of reduced words that represent the 
same element as <A>wd</A>. The elements are output in ascending 
lexicographical order.

<Example>
gap> R:= RootSystem( "F", 4 );;
gap> it:= ReducedWordIterator( WeylGroup(R), LongestWeylWord(R) );
&lt;iterator>
gap> NextIterator( it );
[ 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4 ]
gap> k:= 1;;
gap> while not IsDoneIterator( it ) do
> k:= k+1; w:= NextIterator( it );
> od;
gap> k;
2144892
</Example>
So there are 2144892 reduced expressions for the longest element in the Weyl
group of type <M>F_4</M>.

<ManSection>         
<Oper Name="ExchangeElement" Arg="W, wd, ind"/>
<Description>
Here  <A>W</A>  is a Weyl group, and <A>wd</A> is a <E>reduced</E> word in 
<A>W</A>, and <A>ind</A> is an index between  1  and  the rank of the root 
system. Let <A>v</A> denote the word obtained from <A>wd</A> by adding 
<A>ind</A> at the end. This function <E>assumes</E> that the length of <A>v</A>
is  one  less  than the length of <A>wd</A>, and returns a reduced expression 
for <A>v</A> that is obtained from <A>wd</A> by deleting one entry. Nothing is 
guaranteed of the output if the length of <A>v</A> is bigger than the length 
of <A>wd</A>.

<Example>
gap> R:= RootSystem( "G", 2 );;
gap> wd:= LongestWeylWord( R );;
gap> ExchangeElement( WeylGroup(R), wd, 1 );
[ 2, 1, 2, 1, 2 ]
</Example>
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>         
<Oper Name="GetBraidRelations" Arg="W, wd1, wd2"/>
<Description>
Here  <A>W</A> is a Weyl group, and <A>wd1</A>, <A>wd2</A> are two reduced 
words representing the same  element in <A>W</A>. This function returns a 
list of braid relations that can be  applied  to <A>wd1</A> to obtain 
<A>wd2</A>. Here a braid relation is represented as a list, with at the odd 
positions integers that represent positions in a word,
and  at  the  even  positions  the indices that are on those positions after
applying  the relation. For example, let <A>wd</A> be the word 
<A>[ 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1 ]</A> and  let  <A>r = [ 3, 3, 4, 1 ]</A> be a relation. 
Then the result of applying <A>r</A> to <A>wd</A>  is  
<A>[ 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1]</A>  (i.e., on the third position we put a 3, and on
the fourth position a 1).<P/>
We  note that the function does not check first whether <A>wd1</A> and 
<A>wd2</A> represent the  same  element  in  <A>W</A>. If this is not the 
case, then an error will occur during the execution of the function, or it 
will produce wrong output.

<Example>
gap> R:= RootSystem( "A", 3 );;
gap> wd1:= LongestWeylWord( R );
[ 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1 ]
gap> wd2:= [ 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2 ];;

<Section> <Heading>Quantized enveloping algebras </Heading>

In  <Package>QuaGroup</Package>  we  deal with two types of quantized 
enveloping algebra. First there   are  the  quantized  enveloping  algebras  
defined  over  the  field <Ref Var="QuantumField"/>.  We  say that these 
algebras are <Q>generic</Q> quantized enveloping  algebras,  in  
<Package>QuaGroup</Package>  they  have  the category <A>IsGenericQUEA</A>.
Secondly,  we  deal  with the quantized enveloping algebras that are defined
over a different field.

<ManSection>         
<Attr Name="QuantizedUEA" Arg="R"/>
<Oper Name="QuantizedUEA" Arg="R, F, v"/>
<Attr Name="QuantizedUEA" Arg="L"/>
<Oper Name="QuantizedUEA" Arg="L, F, v"/>
<Description>
In  the  first  two  forms  <A>R</A>  is  a  root system. With only 
<A>R</A> as input, the corresponding  generic  quantized  enveloping  
algebra is constructed. It is stored as an attribute of <A>R</A> (so that 
constructing it twice for the same root system  yields  the  same  object).  
Also  the  root system is stored in the quantized enveloping algebra as the 
attribute <A>RootSystem</A>. <P/>
The  attribute  <A>GeneratorsOfAlgebra</A>  contains  the  generators of a 
PBW-type basis  (see  Section  <Ref Sect="sec2.4"/>),  that  are  constructed  
relative to the reduced expression  for  the  longest element in the Weyl 
group that is contained in <A>LongestWeylWord(  R  )</A>.
We  refer  to  <Ref Oper="ObjByExtRep"/>  for a
description  of  the  construction  of  elements  of  a quantized enveloping
algebra. <P/>
The  call <A>QuantizedUEA( R, F, v )</A> returns the quantized universal 
enveloping algebra  with  quantum  parameter  <A>v</A>, which must lie in the 
field <A>F</A>. In this case the elements of <A>GeneratorsOfAlgebra</A> are 
the images of the generators of the corresponding generic quantized 
enveloping algebra. This means that if <A>v</A> is a root of unity, then the 
generators will not generate the whole algebra, but  rather  a  finite 
dimensional subalgebra (as for instance <M>E_i^k=0</M> for <M>k</M>
large  enough). It is possible to construct elements that do not lie in this
finite dimensional subalgebra using <Ref Oper="ObjByExtRep"/>. <P/>
In  the last two cases <A>L</A> must be a semisimple Lie algebra. The two 
calls are short for <A>QuantizedUEA( RootSystem( L ) )</A> and 
<A>QuantizedUEA( RootSystem( L ), F, v )</A> respectively.
<Example>
# We construct the generic quantized enveloping algebra corresponding
# to the root system of type A2+G2:
gap> R:= RootSystem( [ "A", 2, "G", 2 ] );;
gap> U:= QuantizedUEA( R );
QuantumUEA( &lt;root system of type A2 G2>, Qpar = q )
gap> RootSystem( U );
&lt;root system of type A2 G2>
gap> g:= GeneratorsOfAlgebra( U );
[ F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F7, F8, F9, K1, K1+(q^-1-q)*[ K1 ; 1 ], K2,
  K2+(q^-1-q)*[ K2 ; 1 ], K3, K3+(q^-1-q)*[ K3 ; 1 ], K4,
  K4+(q^-3-q^3)*[ K4 ; 1 ], E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, E6, E7, E8, E9 ]
# These elements generate a PBW-type basis of U; the nine elements Fi,
# and the nine elements Ei correspond to the roots listed in convex order:
gap> PositiveRootsInConvexOrder( R );
[ [ 1, 0, 0, 0 ], [ 1, 1, 0, 0 ], [ 0, 1, 0, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 1, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 3, 1 ], [ 0, 0, 2, 1 ], [ 0, 0, 3, 2 ], [ 0, 0, 1, 1 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 1 ] ]
# So, for example, F5 is an element of weight -[ 0, 0, 3, 1 ].
# We can also multiply elements; the result is written on the PBW-basis:
gap> g[17]*g[4];
(q^-6-1)*F4*[ K4 ; 1 ]+(q^-3)*F4*K4
# Now we construct a non-generic quantized enveloping algebra:
gap> R:= RootSystem( "A", 2 );;
gap> U:= QuantizedUEA( R, CF(3), E(3) );;
gap> g:= GeneratorsOfAlgebra( U );
[ F1, F2, F3, K1, K1+(-E(3)+E(3)^2)*[ K1 ; 1 ], K2,
  K2+(-E(3)+E(3)^2)*[ K2 ; 1 ], E1, E2, E3 ]
</Example>
As  can  be  seen  in the example, every element of <M>U</M> is written as a 
linear combination  of  monomials in the PBW-generators; the generators of 
<M>U^-</M> come first, then the generators of <M>U^0</M>, and finally the 
generators of <M>U^+</M>.

<Oper Name="ObjByExtRep" Arg="fam, list"/>
<Description>
Here  <A>fam</A>  is  the  elements  family  of  a  quantized enveloping 
algebra <A>U</A>. Secondly,  <A>list</A>  is  a  list describing an element of 
<A>U</A>. We explain how this description  works.  First we describe an 
indexing system for the generators of  <A>U</A>. Let <A>R</A> be the root 
system of <A>U</A>. 
Let <A>t</A> be the number of positive roots, and  <A>rank</A>  the  rank of 
the root system. Then the generators of <A>U</A> are <A>Fk</A>, <A>Ki</A>
(and  its  inverse),  <A>Ek</A>,  for <A>k=1...t</A>, <A>i=1..rank</A>. 
(See Section <Ref Sect="sec2.4"/>; for the construction  of the <A>Fk</A>, 
<A>Ek</A>, the value of  <A>LongestWeylWord( R )</A> is used.) Now the index 
of <A>Fk</A> is <A>k</A>, and the 
index of <A>Ek</A> is <A>t+rank+k</A>. Furthermore, elements
of  the  algebra generated by the <A>Ki</A>, and its inverse, are written as 
linear combinations of products of <Q>binomials</Q>, as in Section  
<Ref Sect="sec2.5"/>. The element
<Display> K_i^{d}\begin{bmatrix} K_{i} \\ s \end{bmatrix} </Display>
(where  <M>d=0,1</M>), is indexed as <A>[ t+i, d ]</A> (what happens to the 
<A>s</A> is described later). So an index is either an integer, or a list of 
two integers. <P/>
A  monomial  is  a list of indices, each followed by an exponent. First come
the  indices  of the <A>Fk</A>, (<A>1..t</A>), then come the lists of the form 
<A>[ t+i, d ]</A>, and finally the indices of the <A>Ek</A>. Each index is 
followed by an exponent. An index of the form <A>[ t+i, d ]</A> is followed 
by the <A>s</A> in the above formula. <P/>
The  second  argument  of  <A>ObjByExtRep</A>  is  a  list of monomials 
followed by coefficients. This function returns the element of <A>U</A> 
described by this list.<P/>
Finally we remark that the element
<Display> K_i^{d}\begin{bmatrix} K_{i} \\ s \end{bmatrix} </Display>
is printed as <A>Ki[ Ki ; s ]</A> if <A>d=1</A>, and as <A>[ Ki ; s ]</A> 
if <A>d=0</A>.

<Section> <Heading> Homomorphisms and automorphisms </Heading>

Here we describe functions for creating homomorphisms and
(anti)-automorphisms of a quantized enveloping algebra.

<ManSection>         
<Oper Name="QEAHomomorphism" Arg="U, A, list"/>
<Description>
Here  <A>U</A>  is  a  generic  quantized  enveloping  algebra  (i.e., 
with quantum parameter  <A>&uscore;q</A>),  <A>A</A>  is  an algebra with one 
over <A>QuantumField</A>, and <A>list</A> is a list  of  <A>4*rank</A> 
elements of <A>A</A> (where <A>rank</A> is the rank of the root system of
<A>U</A>).  On  the first rank positions there are the images of the 
<M>F_{\alpha}</M> (where the <M>\alpha</M>  are  simple  roots,  listed  
in the order in which they occur in <A>SimpleSystem(  R  )</A>). On the 
positions <A>rank+1...2*rank</A> are the images of the <M>K_{\alpha}</M>.   
On   the  positions  <A>2*rank+1...3*rank</A>  are  the  images  of  the
<M>K_{\alpha}^{-1}</M>,  and finally on the positions <A>3*rank+1...4*rank</A> 
occur the images of the <M>E_{\alpha}</M>. <P/>
This  function returns the homomorphism <A>U -> A</A>, defined by this data. 
In the example  below  we  construct  a  homomorphism from one quantized 
enveloping algebra into another. Both are constructed relative to the same 
root system, but  with  different reduced expressions for the longest element 
of the Weyl group.

<Oper Name="QEAAutomorphism" Arg="U, list"/>
<Oper Name="QEAAutomorphism" Arg="U, f"/>
<Description>
In  the  first  form <A>U</A> is a generic quantized enveloping algebra 
(i.e., with quantum  parameter  <A>&uscore;q</A>),  and  <A>list</A> is a 
list of <A>4*rank</A> elements of <A>U</A> (where <A>rank</A>  is  the  
rank  of  the  corresponding  root system). On the first <A>rank</A>
positions  there  are  the images of the <M>F_{\alpha}</M> (where the 
<M>\alpha</M> are simple roots, listed in the order in which they occur in 
<A>SimpleSystem( R )</A>). On the positions  <A>rank+1...2*rank</A>  are  
the images of the <M>K_{\alpha}</M>. On the positions
<A>2*rank+1...3*rank</A>  are  the  images  of  the  <M>K_{\alpha}^{-1}</M>, 
and finally on the positions <A>3*rank+1...4*rank</A> occur the images of 
the <M>E_{\alpha}</M>.<P/>
In the second form <A>U</A> is a non-generic quantized enveloping algebra, 
and <A>f</A> is an  automorphism  of the corresponding generic quantized 
enveloping algebra. The  corresponding automorphism of <A>U</A> is 
constructed. In this case <A>f</A> must not be  the  bar-automorphism  of the 
corresponding generic quantized enveloping algebra  (cf. 
<Ref Attr="BarAutomorphism"/>), as this automorphism doesn't work in the 
non-generic case.<P/>
The image of an element <A>x</A> under an automorphism <A>f</A> is computed 
by <A>Image( f, x )</A>.  Note  that  there  is no function for calculating 
pre-images (in general this  seems  to  be  a  very  hard  task).  If  you  
want  the inverse of an automorphism, you have to construct it explicitly 
(e.g., by <A>QEAAutomorphism( U, list )</A>, where <A>list</A> is a list of 
pre-images). <P/>
Below we construct the automorphism <M>\omega</M> (cf. Section 
<Ref Sect="sec2.2"/>) of the quantized
enveloping  of  type  <M>A_3</M>,  when  the  quantum parameter is 
<A>&uscore;q</A>, and when the quantum parameter is a fifth root of unity.
<Example>
# First we construct the quantized enveloping algebra:

# Now, for instance, we map F_{\alpha} to E_{\alpha}, where \alpha
# is a simple root. In order to find where those F_{\alpha}, E_{\alpha}
# are in the list of generators, we look at the list of positive roots
# in convex order:

<Section> <Heading>Hopf algebra structure</Heading>

Here  we describe functions for dealing with the Hopf algebra structure of a
quantized  enveloping algebra. This structure enables us to construct tensor
products,  and  dual modules of modules over a quantized enveloping algebra.
We  refer  to the next section (Section <Ref Sect="sec3.8"/>) for some 
functions for creating modules.

two (anti-) automorphisms of <A>U</A>, where <A>finv</A> is the inverse of

basic functions for algebra modules, which are also applicable to the
modules constructed by the functions described in this section. We mention
<A>MatrixOfAction</A>, <A>DirectSumOfAlgebraModules</A>. The action of an

<Oper Name="HighestWeightModule" Label="for a quantized env. alg." Arg="U, wt"/>
<Description>
Here <A>U</A> is a quantized universal enveloping algebra, and <A>wt</A> 
a dominant weight (i.e.,  a list of length equal to the rank of the root 
system, consisting of non-negative   integers).   This   function   returns  
a  finite-dimensional highest-weight module of highest weight <A>wt</A> over
<A>U</A>. If <A>U</A> is generic then this is the unique irreducible 
highest-weight module over <A>U</A>. Otherwise it is the Weyl  module,  cf.  
Section  <Ref Sect="sec2.5"/>.  In  this  last  case  the  module  is not
necessarily irreducible.<P/>
Let  <A>V</A>  denote the module returned by this function. The first basis 
element of  the  attribute  <A>Basis( V )</A> is a highest-weight vector; 
it is written as <A>1*v0</A>.  Other  basis  elements  are  written as, 
for example, <A>F2*F9*v0</A>, which means  that  this vector is the result 
of letting the PBW-monomial <A>F2*F9</A> act on the highest-weight vector.<P/>

<Example>
gap> U:= QuantizedUEA( RootSystem( [ "A", 2, "G", 2 ] ) );;

the maximal submodule not containing the highest weight vector. This is 
not necessarily equal to <A>V</A> if the quantum parameter is a root of 1.

Here <A>U</A> must be a <E>generic</E> quantized enveloping algebra, and

highest-weight module with highest weight <A>wt</A>. The algorithm uses
tensor products (whence the name). On some inputs this algorithm is
faster than the one use for 
<Ref Oper="HighestWeightModule:for a quantized env. alg."/>, on some inputs
it is slower. I do not know any good heuristics. <P/>
The basis supplied with the module returned is the canonical basis.

<Oper Name="DIYModule" Arg="U, V, acts"/>
<Description>
Here <A>U</A>  is  a generic quantized enveloping algebra, and <A>V</A> is 
a vector space over  the  field <A>QuantumField</A>. <A>U</A> acts on <A>V</A> 
and the action is described by the data  in  the  list <A>acts</A>. 
<A>acts</A> is a list of lists, of length <A>4*l</A>, where <A>l</A> is
the  rank  of  the  root system. <A>acts</A> describes the actions of the 
generators <M>[F_1,...,F_l,K_1,...,K_l,K_1^-1,...,K_l^-1,  E_1,...,E_l ]</M>. 
(Here <M>F_k</M> is the generator <M>F_{\alpha_k}</M>, where <M>\alpha_k</M> 
is the <M>k</M>-th simple root, and likewise for <M>E_k</M>.)  The  action 
of each generator is described by a list of length <A>dim V</A>,
giving  the  images  of the basis elements of <A>V</A>. If an image is zero 
then it may  be  omitted:  in that case there is a <Q>hole</Q> in the list. 
This function returns the <A>U</A>-module defined by the input.<P/>
Let  <A>R</A>  be  a  root  system  of  type <M>A_1</M>, and <A>U</A> the 
corresponding quantized enveloping  algebra  (generated  by  
<M>F, K, K^-1, E</M>). In the example below we construct  the  2-dimensional

Let  <A>M</A> denote the module returned by this function. Then <A>M</A>

<Oper Name="IsomorphismOfTensorModules" Arg="V, W"/>
<Description>
Here <A>V</A>, <A>W</A> are two modules over the same quantized enveloping 
algebra <A>U</A>. This function  returns  a  linear  map  
<M>\theta  : V\otimes W\to W\otimes V</M> that is an isomorphism of U-modules.
<P/>
This  function  is  only  guaranteed  to  work correctly if the Hopf algebra
structure is non-twisted (see <Ref Oper="UseTwistedHopfStructure"/>). <P/>
This function works for modules for which <Ref Attr="WeightsAndVectors"/> 
works.

<Description>
Here <A>file</A> is a string containing the name of a file, to which a module 
over a  quantized  enveloping  algebra  has  been  written  by

precisely: a new module is constructed  that  is  isomorphic to the old one. 
In the process the algebra acting  on  the  module is constructed anew (from 
data written to the file). This algebra can be accessed by 
<A>LeftActingAlgebra( V )</A>. <P/>
We  remark  that  this  function  currently  is only implemented for generic

<Description>
Here <A>B</A>  is  the  canonical  basis  of  a  quantized  uea,  and

It  is  possible  to add the option <A>lowrank</A>, as follows 
<A>PBWElements( B, rt :lowrank  )</A>.  In  that case a somewhat different 
method will be used, that is significantly faster if the underlying root

For  example,  if on the <M>k</M>-th position of the list returned by this

<Oper Name="Ealpha" Label="for a crystal vector" Arg="v, ind"/>
<Description>
Here <A>v</A> is a crystal vector, i.e., an element of 
<A>CrystalVectors( V )</A>, where <A>V</A> is a left module over a
quantized enveloping algebra. This function  returns  the  result  of  
applying  the  <A>ind</A>-th Kashiwara operator
<M>\widetilde{E}_{\alpha_{<A>ind</A>}}</M> to v. The result is <A>fail</A>    
if <M>\widetilde{E}_{\alpha_{<A>ind</A>}}</M><A>(v)=0</A>.

<Section> <Heading> Universal enveloping algebras </Heading>
Here  we describe functions for connecting a quantized enveloping algebra to
the corresponding universal enveloping algebra.

<ManSection> 
<Attr Name="UEA" Arg="L"/>
<Description>
This  function  returns the universal enveloping algebra <A>u</A> of the 
semisimple Lie  algebra <A>L</A>. The generators of <A>u</A> are the 
generators of a Kostant lattice in the universal enveloping algebra (these 
generators are obtained from <A>L</A> by
<A>LatticeGeneratorsInUEA( L )</A>, see the &GAP; reference manual).
<Example>
gap> L:= SimpleLieAlgebra( "B", 2, Rationals );
&lt;Lie algebra of dimension 10 over Rationals>
gap> u:= UEA( L );
&lt;algebra over Rationals, with 10 generators>
gap> g:= GeneratorsOfAlgebra( u );
[ y1, y2, y3, y4, x1, x2, x3, x4, ( h9/1 ), ( h10/1 ) ]
</Example>
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection> 
<Attr Name="UnderlyingLieAlgebra" Arg="u"/>
<Description>
For  a  universal  enveloping  algebra  <A>u</A>  constructed by 
<Ref Attr="UEA"/>, this returns the corresponding semisimple Lie algebra
<Example>
gap> L:= SimpleLieAlgebra( "B", 2, Rationals );;
gap> u:= UEA( L );;
gap> UnderlyingLieAlgebra( u );
&lt;Lie algebra of dimension 10 over Rationals>
</Example>
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection> 
<Oper Name="HighestWeightModule" Label="for a universal env. alg" Arg="u, hw"/>
<Description>
For a universal enveloping algebra <A>u</A> constructed by <Ref Attr="UEA"/>, 
this returns the irreducible highest weight module over <A>u</A> with highest 
weight <A>hw</A>, which must be dominant. This module
is the same as the corresponding highest weight module over the semisimple
Lie algebra, but in this case the enveloping algebra <A>u</A> acts.
<Example>
gap> L:= SimpleLieAlgebra( "B", 2, Rationals );;
gap> u:= UEA( L );;
gap> HighestWeightModule( u, [2,3] );
&lt;140-dimensional left-module over &lt;algebra over Rationals, with
10 generators>>
</Example>
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection> 
<Attr Name="QUEAToUEAMap" Arg="L"/>
<Description>
Here <A>L</A> is a semisimple Lie algebra. Set <A>u := UEA( L )</A>, and 
<A>U := QuantizedUEA( L )</A> (so <A>u, U</A> are the universal enveloping 
algebra, and <Q>generic</Q>  quantized  enveloping  algebra  of  <A>L</A>  
respectively). Then <A>QUEAToUEAMap( L )</A> returns the algebra homomorphism 
from <A>U</A> to <A>u</A> obtained by mapping <A>q</A> to <A>1</A>, a 
generator <A>Fi</A>, corresponding to a simple root to the generator 
<A>yi</A> (corresponding to the same simple root), and likewise for <A>Ei</A>
and <A>xi</A>. This means that <A>Ki</A> is mapped to one, and 
<A>[ Ki : s ]</A> to <A>hi</A> choose <A>s</A>. <P/>
The canonical basis of <A>U</A> is mapped to the canonical basis of <A>u</A>.
<Example>
gap> L:= SimpleLieAlgebra( "B", 2, Rationals );;
gap> f:= QUEAToUEAMap( L );
&lt;mapping: QuantumUEA( &lt;root system of rank
2>, Qpar = q ) -> Algebra( Rationals, [ y1, y2, y3, y4, x1, x2, x3, x4,
  ( h9/1 ), ( h10/1 ) ] ) >
gap> U:= Source( f );
QuantumUEA( &lt;root system of rank 2>, Qpar = q )
gap> u:= Range( f );
&lt;algebra over Rationals, with 10 generators>
gap> B:= CanonicalBasis( U );;
gap> p:= PBWElements( B, [1,2] );
[ F1*F4^(2), (q+q^3)*F1*F4^(2)+F2*F4, (q^4)*F1*F4^(2)+(q)*F2*F4+F3 ]
gap> pu:= List( p, x -> Image( f, x ) );
[ y1*y2^(2), 2*y1*y2^(2)+y2*y3-2*y4, y1*y2^(2)+y2*y3-1*y4 ]
gap> V:= HighestWeightModule( u, [2,1] );
&lt;40-dimensional left-module over &lt;algebra over Rationals, with
10 generators>>
gap> List( pu, x -> x^Basis(V)[1] );
[ 0*v0, y2*y3*v0+-2*y4*v0, y2*y3*v0+-1*y4*v0 ]
# Which gives us a piece of the canonical basis of V.
